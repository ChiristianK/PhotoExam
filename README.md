# PhotoExam: Essay Exam Grader
In the current era of learning in Indonesia, essay-shaped exams are still widely used. This obligates teachers to review the essay one by one in grading process. One of the problems that teachers currently experience is that it requires a lot of time to grade an essay. At times the answer can be hard to read, and the huge quantity of essays can cause the quality of scoring to degrade. Approximately 90% of teachers stated that exhaustion would lead to inconsistencies in grading.

We saw the condition of teaching and learning in Indonesia, which still uses a lot of essay assignments or exams. And in grading these essays, teachers are often careless and prone to grading errors. PhotoExam can help reduce grading errors by providing consistency in grading and calculating grades accurately. With faster and more accurate grading, students will also get faster feedback, which can help them understand the strengths and weaknesses in their writing, which will also lead to improve student learning and development.
This is what underlies our team to create an application to aid the teachers in grading the essays. We hope that this application could accelerate and ease the process of grading an essay to the teachers.

PhotoExam is an application that aims to ease the process of grading an essay. PhotoExam could scan a student's essay answer and compare it to the teacher’s answer key to determine the score of the student’s essay.Thus, the grading process could be done in a glimpse without burdening the teachers.

Our team believes that Photoexam can make the teacher’s work easier in the teaching and learning process. Thus we hope that PhotoExam can increase teaching’s efficiency in Indonesia.
